### What I learned

- Reactive icon change in Vue
- API calls with Axios (GET/POST), and managing responses
- Creating a library of UI components
- Building a good project structure
- Creating a dark mode toggle
- Advanced router view with history functionality
- Form creation

### Optimizations

There is still room for improvement for me, for example:
- Some functionality could be split further into separate files
- Tests are not implemented
- API call errors are not handled fully (with redirection)
- When loading gallery I have to wait until all images are loaded, could be fixed
