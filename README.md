## My process

### Built with

- HTML5/CSS + BEM naming with additional style classes
- Desktop-first workflow
- Axios for api calls
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework using Options API

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

There is still room for improvement for me, for example:
- My smaller device layouts are not perfect
- Some functionality could be split further into separate files
- Dark mode is not implemented
- Tests are not implemented
- API call errors are not handled fully (with redirection)

## Acknowledgments

Thanks for letting me try myself in this test task. You know who you are!
