## Overview

### The challenge

This project goal was to create a web application for viewing cute cats from [https://www.thecatapi.com/](https://www.thecatapi.com/)!

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5/CSS + BEM naming with additional style classes
- Desktop-first workflow
- Axios for api calls
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework using Options API

### What I learned

- Reactive icon change in Vue
- API calls with Axios (GET/POST), and managing responses
- Creating a library of UI components
- Building a good project structure
- Creating a dark mode toggle
- Advanced router view with history functionality
- Form creation


### Continued development

There is still room for improvement for me, for example:
- Some functionality could be split further into separate files
- Tests are not implemented
- API call errors are not handled fully (with redirection)

## Acknowledgments

Thanks for letting me try myself in this test task. You know who you are!
